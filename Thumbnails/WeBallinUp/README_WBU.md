# We Ballin' Up

**We Ballin' Up** is a physics-based football game focused on mastering the art of free kicks. Control the power, direction, and effect applied to the ball to score impressive goals in challenging scenarios. Defenders—including barrier defenders, basic defenders, and a goalkeeper—come with unique behaviors to make each shot count. Designed with competitive free-kick gameplay at its core, *We Ballin' Up* is in active development and hosted on GitHub.
